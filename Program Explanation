1.	Face Recognition Setup:
  o	The load_reference_image() function loads the user's reference face image from the file system (e.g., my_face.jpg). 
    The face encoding is then extracted using the face_recognition library.

  o	The compare_faces() function compares the encoding of the captured image (from the webcam) with the reference encoding.

2.	Webcam Capture:
  o	Using OpenCV (cv2.VideoCapture(0)), the script captures frames from the webcam in real-time.
  o	The captured frame is processed to check if there is a face, and if it matches the reference face.

3.	Text-to-Speech:
  o	The pyttsx3 library provides verbal feedback, so the system can notify the user whether the face was recognized or not.

4.	Face Matching:
  o	The face_recognition.compare_faces() method compares the encoding of the face detected in the webcam feed with the reference image encoding. 
    If the face matches, access is granted, and the script stops. If it doesn't match, it asks the user to try again.

5.	Security Consideration:
  o	The script runs in a loop, asking the user to look at the camera until the face is recognized.
  o	If no match is found, it will keep asking the user to try again, ensuring that the correct user is authenticated before proceeding.

How to Use:
1.	Set Up the Reference Image: 
  o	Take a clear photo of your face (e.g., my_face.jpg), and place it in the same directory as the script 
  (or update the reference_image_path in the script to the correct location of the image).

2.	Run the Script: 
  o	When you run the script, it will prompt you to look at the camera. The script will attempt to match the face in the camera feed with the reference image.
  o	If the face matches, the script will grant access (you can add functionality to launch programs or unlock your laptop).
  o	If no match is found, it will prompt you to try again.

Example Interaction:
  •	User: Runs the script.
  •	Script: "Please look at the camera for verification."
  •	User: Looks at the camera.
  •	Script: "Face recognized! Access granted." (or "Face not recognized. Please try again." if the face doesn't match)

Additional Features You Can Add:
1.	Lock and Unlock Laptop:
  o	You can integrate this facial recognition system with a system lock/unlock function to actually secure access to your laptop.

2.	Multiple Users:
  o	Store multiple reference images for different users and check against each stored reference.

3.	Logging and Auditing:
  o	Log when and who accessed the laptop (if supporting multiple users).

Note:
This facial recognition system provides a simple, interactive way to add an extra layer of security to your laptop. 
However, always be aware that facial recognition is not foolproof and can be bypassed in some scenarios.
